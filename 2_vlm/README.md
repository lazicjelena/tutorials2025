# [[M2L2025](https://www.m2lschool.org/home)] Tutorial 2: Vision Language Models

**Authors:** Alexandre Galashov (agalashov@google.com), Petra Bevandic (Petra.Bevandic@fer.hr )

**Abstract**: In this tutorial we'll explore how we can use image-text data to build Vision Language Models (VLMs) 🚀. We'll start with an introduction to multimodal understanding that describes the main components of a Vision Lanugage Model. Then, we'll dive into Vision Transformer (ViT), a popular architecture which is used in VLMs as Image Encoder (Practical 1). It will be followed in Practical 2 which will dive into Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), a model for learning general representation from image-text pairs that can be used for a wide range of downstream tasks. We will also dive into different applications of CLIP. Finally, in Practical 3, we will actually use a pretrained VLM and do a finetuning to a given task.
